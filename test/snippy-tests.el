;;; Commentary:

;; Tests for Snippy.el.  These tests are AI generated.

;; To run:
;; emacs -batch -f package-initialize -l snippy.el -l snippy-tests.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
;; YAsnippets needs to be installed inside your Emacs config directory for this command.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'snippy)
